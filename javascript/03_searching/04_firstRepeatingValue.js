// Given an array arr[], find the first repeating element index. The element should occur more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

// Note:- The position you return should be according to 1-based indexing. 

// Examples:

// Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 5 appears twice and its first appearance is at index 2 which is less than 3 whose first the occurring index is 3.
// Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
// Output: -1
// Explanation: All elements appear only once so answer is -1.
// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
// 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106


let arr = [1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
